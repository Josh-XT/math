Certainly! To make sure that the equations and symbols parse properly on GitHub using Markdown, you can use GitHub-flavored Markdown for math. GitHub supports LaTeX-style math using the `$$` delimiters for block equations and single `$` delimiters for inline equations. However, it should be noted that GitHub does not natively render LaTeX math in Markdown files. Instead, you may need to use tools like [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) or convert your Markdown files to HTML with support for LaTeX math.

Here’s how you can format the document to be compatible with Markdown, and then use LaTeX rendering tools to display the math correctly on GitHub or other platforms that support LaTeX:

### Updated Formatting for Math Parsing in Markdown:

For GitHub, you can include the math inline within text using single `$` or double `$$` for standalone block equations. Here's the formatted text:

# Math

## 1. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) \, dt = f(x)
$$

### Experiment: Water Flowing from a Funnel into a Container

### Materials Needed:
- Funnel
- Large container (like a measuring jug)
- Small cup (e.g., 10 ml or 50 ml)
- Stopwatch
- Water

### Steps to Show the Math:
1. **Set Up:** Place the funnel over the large container. Make sure the container is stable to avoid spills.
2. **Measure Flow Rate:** 
   - Start with a small amount of water in the funnel. Place the small cup under the funnel's spout.
   - Use the stopwatch to measure the time it takes to fill the small cup (e.g., 10 seconds for 10 ml, meaning the flow rate is 1 ml/sec).
3. **Calculate Total Water (Integration):**
   - Predict the total water collected in the large container after 1 minute using the flow rate.
   - For example, if the flow rate is 1 ml/sec, then in 60 seconds, the total water should be \( 1 \times 60 = 60 \, \text{ml} \).
4. **Direct Measurement:** Allow water to flow for 1 minute, then measure the actual water collected in the container.
5. **Explanation:** Explain that the total amount of water collected (integral) is found by adding up small amounts of water over time. The flow rate (derivative) tells how fast water is flowing at any moment.

### What the Symbols Mean:
- **\(\int_a^x f(t) \, dt\):** The integral represents adding up all the tiny pieces of a quantity from point \(a\) to point \(x\), like summing up the small amounts of water over time.
- **\(\frac{d}{dx}\):** The derivative measures how something is changing at a specific point. It’s like asking, "How fast is the water flowing right now?"
- **\(f(t)\):** The function that describes the flow rate of water over time.
- **\(f(x)\):** The value of the function at a specific point \(x\), telling us the flow rate at that moment.

### Why This Equation is Important:
- The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects two major concepts in mathematics: differentiation and integration. This connection allows us to calculate areas and volumes and solve real-world problems involving rates of change, such as speed and growth.

### Historical Example:
- Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently developed calculus in the late 17th century. This theorem has since been crucial in understanding motion, area, and growth, making it fundamental to modern science and engineering.

### How to Explain to Kids:
- “When we collect water in a cup over time, we can add up all the little drops to find out how much water we have. That’s what integration does. If we want to know how fast the water is coming out right now, we use the derivative.”

## 2. Newton's Second Law of Motion

$$
F = ma
$$

### Experiment: Toy Car on a Ramp with Different Weights

### Materials Needed:
- Toy car
- Ramp (a piece of wood or a book inclined on a stack)
- Small weights (like coins or small bags of rice)
- Stopwatch
- Measuring tape or ruler

### Steps to Show the Math:
1. **Set Up:** Place the ramp on an inclined surface. Ensure it's stable.
2. **Measure Car Mass:** Weigh the toy car using a kitchen scale. Note its mass (e.g., 0.5 kg).
3. **Calculate Acceleration:**
   - Release the car from the top of the ramp. Use the stopwatch to measure the time it takes to reach the bottom.
   - Calculate acceleration using the formula \( \text{acceleration} = \frac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time}} \). For simplicity, assume it starts from rest and use distance/time squared.
4. **Calculate Force:**
   - Attach different weights to the car and repeat the experiment.
   - Use \( F = ma \) to calculate the force. For instance, with mass \( 0.5 \, \text{kg} \) and acceleration \( 2 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), force \( F = 0.5 \times 2 = 1 \, \text{N} \).
5. **Explanation:** Discuss how increasing the car's weight or changing the ramp’s angle affects the speed. Show that force makes objects accelerate faster.

### What the Symbols Mean:
- **\(F\):** Force, the push or pull on an object, measured in newtons (N).
- **\(m\):** Mass of the object, measured in kilograms (kg). It’s how heavy the car is.
- **\(a\):** Acceleration, measured in meters per second squared (m/s\(^2\)). It tells us how quickly the speed of the car is changing.

### Why This Equation is Important:
- Newton's Second Law explains how forces cause changes in motion, making it foundational in understanding mechanics. It applies to everything from everyday objects like cars to planetary motions in space.

### Historical Example:
- Isaac Newton formulated this law in the 17th century. It laid the groundwork for classical mechanics and was critical in explaining phenomena such as the movement of planets and the laws of motion on Earth.

### How to Explain to Kids:
- “If you push a toy car, it goes faster. The heavier the car, the harder you need to push to make it go fast. This equation shows how the force you use depends on how heavy the car is and how fast you want it to go.”

## 3. The Ideal Gas Law

$$
PV = nRT
$$

### Experiment: Balloon Over a Bottle in Warm Water

### Materials Needed:
- Small balloon
- Bottle (glass or plastic)
- Warm water
- Measuring tape
- Thermometer

### Steps to Show the Math:
1. **Set Up:** Stretch the balloon over the bottle's opening. Ensure it's sealed tightly.
2. **Measure Initial Balloon Volume:** Measure the balloon’s circumference while at room temperature to estimate its volume.
3. **Change Temperature:** Place the bottle in a bowl of warm water. Observe the balloon inflating as the temperature rises.
4. **Measure New Volume:** Measure the balloon’s circumference again to estimate the increased volume.
5. **Explanation:** Explain that warming the air inside the bottle makes it expand, filling the balloon. Relate this to the Ideal Gas Law, showing how volume increases with temperature.

### What the Symbols Mean:
- **\(P\):** Pressure of the gas, measured in atmospheres (atm) or pascals (Pa). It’s like how much the gas is pushing against the balloon.
- **\(V\):** Volume of the gas, measured in liters (L) or cubic meters (m\(^3\)). It’s the space the gas takes up.
- **\(n\):** Number of moles of gas, which is a way to count how many gas particles there are.
- **\(R\):** Gas constant, a fixed number (\(8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}\)) that relates the other units.
- **\(T\):** Temperature of the gas, measured in kelvin (K). It’s how hot the gas is.

### Why This Equation is Important:
- The Ideal Gas Law helps us understand and predict the behavior of gases under different conditions. It's crucial in fields like chemistry, physics, and engineering for processes like chemical reactions and engine operations.

### Historical Example:
- Developed over time by scientists like Robert Boyle, Jacques Charles, and Amedeo Avogadro, this law became essential in the 19th century. It helped chemists understand how gases behave and how they could be used in various applications, from balloons to industrial processes.

### How to Explain to Kids:
- “When you warm up the gas in the bottle, it makes the gas molecules move faster and push out more, so the balloon gets bigger. The equation shows how pressure, volume, and temperature are related. If one changes, the others change too.”
