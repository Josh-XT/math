## 1. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) \, dt = f(x)
$$

### Experiment: Water Flowing from a Funnel into a Container

### Materials Needed:
- Funnel
- Large container (like a measuring jug)
- Small cup (e.g., 10 ml or 50 ml)
- Stopwatch
- Water

### Steps to Show the Math:
1. **Set Up:** Place the funnel over the large container. Make sure the container is stable to avoid spills.
2. **Measure Flow Rate:** 
   - Start with a small amount of water in the funnel. Place the small cup under the funnel's spout.
   - Use the stopwatch to measure the time it takes to fill the small cup (e.g., 10 seconds for 10 ml, meaning the flow rate is 1 ml/sec).
3. **Calculate Total Water (Integration):**
   - Predict the total water collected in the large container after 1 minute using the flow rate.
   - For example, if the flow rate is 1 ml/sec, then in 60 seconds, the total water should be \( 1 \times 60 = 60 \, \text{ml} \).
4. **Direct Measurement:** Allow water to flow for 1 minute, then measure the actual water collected in the container.
5. **Explanation:** Explain that the total amount of water collected (integral) is found by adding up small amounts of water over time. The flow rate (derivative) tells how fast water is flowing at any moment.

### What the Symbols Mean:
- **\(\int_a^x f(t) \, dt\):** The integral represents adding up all the tiny pieces of a quantity from point \(a\) to point \(x\), like summing up the small amounts of water over time.
- **\(\frac{d}{dx}\):** The derivative measures how something is changing at a specific point. It’s like asking, "How fast is the water flowing right now?"
- **\(f(t)\):** The function that describes the flow rate of water over time.
- **\(f(x)\):** The value of the function at a specific point \(x\), telling us the flow rate at that moment.

### Why This Equation is Important:
- The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects two major concepts in mathematics: differentiation and integration. This connection allows us to calculate areas and volumes and solve real-world problems involving rates of change, such as speed and growth.

### Historical Example:
- Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently developed calculus in the late 17th century. This theorem has since been crucial in understanding motion, area, and growth, making it fundamental to modern science and engineering.

### How to Explain to Kids:
- “When we collect water in a cup over time, we can add up all the little drops to find out how much water we have. That’s what integration does. If we want to know how fast the water is coming out right now, we use the derivative.”

3. **Calculate Acceleration:**
   - Release the car from the top of the ramp. Use the stopwatch to measure the time it takes to reach the bottom.
   - Calculate acceleration using the formula \( \text{acceleration} = \frac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time}} \). For simplicity, assume it starts from rest and use distance/time squared.
4. **Calculate Force:**
   - Attach different weights to the car and repeat the experiment.
   - Use \( F = ma \) to calculate the force. For instance, with mass \( 0.5 \, \text{kg} \) and acceleration \( 2 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), force \( F = 0.5 \times 2 = 1 \, \text{N} \).
5. **Explanation:** Discuss how increasing the car's weight or changing the ramp’s angle affects the speed. Show that force makes objects accelerate faster.
